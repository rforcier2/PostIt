"NexxUs" is a generic Social Media clone built with PHP and SQL backend. It is built in a MVC architecture and is based on a course from Udemy. 
This site contains basic examples of:
 - user sign-up
 - user sign-in
 - making posts as a signed-in user
 - following other users as a signed-in user
 - unfollowing other users as a signed-in user
 - search for other users by name or post text.

**How to host?**
 - set up a SQL server to host your tables as you name them
 - Even Apache / localhost may work as it should function with any server that can handle PHP requests
